# jenkins-x

Jenkins-X will handle the CICD of the app.

## Install

https://jenkins-x.io/docs/resources/guides/managing-jx/old/install-on-cluster/

### Get the jx CLI tool

Install the `jx` command. On mac run
```
brew install jenkins-x/jx/jx
```

See [here](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/install-setup/install-binary/) for other OS steps.


### Check compliance


```
# This takes like an hour, skip it if you're sure it'll pass
jx compliance run
jx compliance status

# Compliance tests are still running, it can take up to 60 minutes. ... wait
while true; do date; jx compliance status; sleep 60; done

jx compliance results

jx compliance delete
```

### Run the install

The current `jx boot` command is defective and does not work with the format of GitHub tokens
that are now issued. Run the command then fix it up. Once this [bug](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/7633)
is closed, the issue will be resolved.

```
jx boot
```

It will error out when you try and pass your GitHub token saying that it doesn't match the regex.
From inside the `jenkins-x-boot-config` directory, fix the defect.

`vi ./env/parameters.tmpl.schema.json`

Change `"pattern": "^[0-9a-f]{40}$` to `"pattern": "^[0-9a-zA-Z_]{40}$"`

Then re-run the boot wizard

```
jx boot
```

Then it will fail with

```
error: failed to lint the chart '/var/folders/95/31l7sb597p3107yds9lky4tc0000gn/T/jx-helm-apply-584207017/env': failed to run 'helm lint --set tags.jx-lint=true --set global.jxLint=true --set-string global.jxTypeEnv=lint' command in directory '/var/folders/95/31l7sb597p3107yds9lky4tc0000gn/T/jx-helm-apply-584207017/env', output: '==> Linting .

```

At this point, you might decide that Jenkins X is not ready for production and use something else.
